# AI Contribution Guidelines

These rules govern how AI assistance is used while contributing to this project (hosted on a third-party GitHub account).

## What AI May Do
- Summarize requirements, propose designs, and draft small code changes that follow existing patterns.
- Suggest tests, lint/config updates, and refactors that keep behavior intact.
- Help write documentation, ADRs, and deployment notes based on existing public repo context.

## What AI Must Not Do
- Do not invent or copy proprietary code/content from outside this repo.
- Do not paste secrets, credentials, tokens, or private data into prompts or generated output.
- Do not auto-approve merges or bypass human review; always keep a human in control.
- Do not reformat large files needlessly or rewrite user-owned changes.

## Privacy and Data Handling
- Keep prompts minimal; share only the code/context required for the task.
- Never send database dumps, full env files, or PII to external services.
- Strip secrets from logs and error messages before sharing or committing.

## Coding and Quality Rules
- Follow existing code style, folder layout, and naming conventions.
- Prefer minimal, targeted diffs with clear rationale and inline comments only when code is non-obvious.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes; run relevant checks (pytest, tsc, npm test) when possible.
- Document behavioral changes in PR descriptions and changelogs when required.

## Working With the Upstream Repository
- Upstream remote: `origin` points to a third-party GitHub account. Verify you have push/PR rights; otherwise fork and open a PR from your fork.
- Create branches per task; keep PRs small and self-contained with reproducible steps and test results.
- Reference related issues/tickets in the PR body; call out migrations, breaking changes, or config impacts explicitly.
- Avoid force-pushes to shared branches; never rewrite history of branches you do not own.

## Review and Transparency
- Disclose AI assistance in PR descriptions when substantial content was generated by AI.
- Request human review for all non-trivial changes; include test evidence or manual verification steps.

## Security and Compliance Checklist (pre-PR)
- [ ] No secrets or tokens introduced or logged.
- [ ] Schema/migration reviewed and idempotent; data migrations have backups/rollbacks.
- [ ] Feature flags/configs documented; defaults safe for production.
- [ ] Tests updated or added; key paths manually verified when applicable.

## When to Escalate
- Unsure about data sensitivity, licensing, or policy fit.
- Production-impacting changes, schema updates, or auth/crypto logic.
- Conflicting stakeholder requirements or unclear acceptance criteria.
